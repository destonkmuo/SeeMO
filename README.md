# SeeMO

A desktop notes app built with Electron, React, and TypeScript. Notes live as
plain Markdown files in a local vault, with tabs, dockable images, tasks, a
calendar, and a voice-driven assistant.

## Features

- **Block notes** — every note is a stack of blocks: paragraphs, checklists,
  quotes, code, math (KaTeX), and images.
- **Dockable images** — drag & drop or paste pictures in, unlock them to dock
  left / center / right with text wrapping, drag to move them between blocks.
- **Tabs & groups** — browser-style tabs with back/forward history, split view,
  and color-coded tab groups.
- **Collapsible sidebar** — Notion-style toggle, `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `S` to
  show/hide, width persists across sessions.
- **Spotlight search** — `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `T` or `K` to fuzzy-search notes,
  tasks, pages, and commands.
- **Tasks & calendar** — todos with due dates, a month view, local + subscribed
  calendars, and reminders with sound.
- **Graph view** — `[[wikilinks]]` between notes rendered as a knowledge graph.
- **Voice assistant** — push-to-talk orb with transcripts, TTS replies, and an
  agentic core that can read and edit your notes.
- **Local-first vault** — everything is stored under `~/Documents/SeeMO` as
  `.md` + `.json`, with optional GitHub sync.
